  "detailed_analysis": "## Overview of Latest Electric Vehicle Models and Safety Features\n\nThis report summarizes the latest electric vehicle (EV) models available in India as of July 2025, along with an overview of their safety features and ratings. The information is compiled from multiple sources including CarDekho, CarWale, Holman Automotive, the Department of Energy (.gov), IIHS-HLDI, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (.gov).\n\n## Latest EV Models in India (July 2025)\n\nSeveral new and upcoming electric cars are available in the Indian market. Some of the popular models include:\n\n*   **Tesla Model Y:**  A popular electric car with prices ranging from Rs. 59.89 to 73.89 Lakh.\n*   **Mahindra BE 6:** Priced between Rs. 18.90 to 27.65 Lakh.\n*   **Tata Harrier EV:** Available in the range of Rs. 21.49 to 30.23 Lakh.\n*   **MG Windsor EV:** Costs between Rs. 14 to 18.31 Lakh.\n*   **Mahindra XEV 9e:** Priced from Rs. 21.90 to 31.25 Lakh.\n*   **Kia Carens Clavis EV:** Priced at Rs. 17.99 Lakh\n*   **Tata Punch EV:** Priced at Rs 9.99 Lakh\n*   **Tata Tiago EV:** Priced at Rs 7.99 Lakh\n*   **MG Comet EV:** Priced at Rs 6.18 Lakh\n\nUpcoming models include MG M9, MG Cyberster, Maruti e Vitara and Toyota Urban Cruiser EV.\n\n## Safety Features in Electric Vehicles\n\nEVs are equipped with several safety features, including:\n\n*   **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS):** Includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure warnings, and automated emergency braking.\n*   **Regenerative Braking:** Uses the electric motor to decelerate the vehicle, enhancing control during abrupt stops.\n*   **Battery Management System (BMS):** Monitors and optimizes battery performance for safe and efficient operation.\n*   **Collision Avoidance Systems:** Provides timely alerts to the driver to mitigate the risk of collisions.\n*   **Blind Spot Monitoring:** Alerts drivers about vehicles in obscured areas.\n*   **Rearview Camera:** Enhances visibility, sometimes offering a 360-degree panoramic view.\n*   **Cybersecurity Measures:** Protects against unauthorized data access.\n*   **Fire-Resistant Materials:** Addresses battery combustion challenges.\n*   **Structural Design:** Lower center of gravity and reinforced frames reduce rollover risks.\n\n## Safety Ratings\n\nOrganizations like IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) and NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) evaluate vehicle safety through crash tests and ratings.\n\n*   **IIHS:** Evaluates crashworthiness and crash avoidance/mitigation technologies.\n*   **NHTSA:** Conducts frontal, side, and rollover tests, providing 5-Star Safety Ratings.\n\nNHTSA also recommends driver assistance technologies like Forward Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Dynamic Brake Support.\n\n## Maintenance and Emergency Response\n\n*   EVs generally require less maintenance than conventional vehicles due to fewer moving parts and regenerative braking.\n*   Emergency response for EVs is similar to conventional vehicles, with cutoff switches to isolate the battery.\n*   First responders are encouraged to consult manufacturer guides for specific procedures.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe latest EV models come equipped with advanced safety features and undergo rigorous testing. Government initiatives are promoting EV adoption through tax benefits and infrastructure development, contributing to a safer and more sustainable automotive future.",
